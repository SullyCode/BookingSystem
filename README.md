# TheatreBookingSystem
Project Scope: 
- The project is a new booking system for The Theatre Royal. The User Interface is text-based using the console. There is a separate application for Theatre Employees and for the General Public to use to book tickets.
- The theatre offers information regarding forthcoming shows, and  allows people to
purchase performance tickets online.
The interface ensures that users of the application can find the following information for
any show: The title of the show; The type of show (theatre, musical, opera, concert); A description; When performances of the show are staged (times – matinee or evening – and dates);The duration of a performance; The price of tickets for a performance; The availability of tickets for a performance.

Breakdown of project design and implementation:
- **Design and implement the underlying database**: Deteremined the entities and attributes along with any other data necessary, and identified that data which needs to be stored within the database.
- **Design and implement the back-end model for the shows/performances:** Implemented the design of the class diagram and identified the relationship between the classes. Intergrated the JDBC API and determined how to connect this middleware to the front-end interface.
- **Design and implement front-end interface:** Users are be able to browse shows/performances, Users should are able to search for a particular show, or view performances on a particular date, Users are able to select tickets for purchase. Users may purchase multiple tickets, possibly for multiple shows, in one transaction,  Screen(s) exist to allow the user to see which tickets, for which shows, they have selected for purchase, and to allow the user to enter the details necessary to complete a purchase.


Application Testing - TDD

- TDD Read, Understand and Process the various features being implemented for the project
- TDD Translated project requirements by writing unit tests 
- TDD Implement code that fulfils the requirements
- Cleaning up code by refactoring (repeated process for further features/ requirements)


Task Managment: 
- Made use of Trello to delegate and keep track of current tasks given 
- Keeping track of database, back-end & front-end interface was made easier
