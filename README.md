# TheatreBookingSystem
Project Scope and requirements 
- The project is to create a new booking system for The Theatre Royal. The User Interface will
be text-based using the console. This can be a separate application for Theatre Employees
and for the General Public to use to book tickets.
- The theatre wants to offer information regarding forthcoming shows, and to allow people to
purchase performance tickets online.
The interface should ensure that users of the application can find the following information for
any show: The title of the show; The type of show (theatre, musical, opera, concert); A description; When performances of the show are staged (times – matinee or evening – and dates);The duration of a performance; The price of tickets for a performance; The availability of tickets for a performance.

Breakdown of project design and implementation:
- Design and implement the underlying database: Deteremined the entities and attributes along with any other data necessary, and identified that data which needs to be stored within the database.
- Design and implement the back-end model for the shows/performances: Implemented the design of the class diagram and identified the relationship between the classes. Intergrated the JDBC API and determined how to connect this middleware to the front-end interface.
- Implement the front-end interface: Users should be able to browse shows/performances, Users should be able to search for a particular show, or view performances on a particular date, Users should be able to select tickets for purchase. Users may purchase multiple tickets, possibly for multiple shows, in one transaction,  Screen(s) must exist to allow the user to see which tickets, for which shows, they have selected for purchase, and to allow the user to enter the details necessary to complete a purchase.
